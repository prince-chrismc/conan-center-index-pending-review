# Contributing

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Please note we have a [code of conduct](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/conan-center-index-pending-review/blob/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
please follow it in all your interactions with the project.

Contributions of all kinds are welcome. In particular pull requests are appreciated. The authors will endeavour to help walk you through any issues
in the pull request discussion, so please feel free to open a pull request even if you are new to such things.

## Types of Contributions

### Issues

The easiest contribution to make is to [file an issue](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/conan-center-index-pending-review/issues/new). It is beneficial if you perform
a cursory search of [existing issues](https://github.com/Tprince-chrismc/conan-center-index-pending-review/issues?q=is%3Aissue) and it is also helpful, but not necessary,
if you can provide clear instruction for how to reproduce a problem. If you have resolved an issue yourself please consider contributing code to this repository so others can
benefit from your work.

### Documentation

Contributing to documentation is the easiest way to get started. Providing simple clear or helpful documentation for new users is critical. Anything that *you* as
a new user found hard to understand, or difficult to work out, are excellent places to begin. Contributions to more detailed and descriptive error messages is
especially appreciated. To contribute to the documentation please [fork the project](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/conan-center-index-pending-review/fork) into your
own repository, make changes there, and then submit a pull request.

### Code

Code contributions are always welcome, from simple bug fixes, to new features. Please first discuss the change you wish to make by opening an issue.
To contribute code please [fork the project](https://github.com/prince-chrismc/conan-center-index-pending-review/fork) into your own repository, make changes there.
When submitting changes please make sure to lint and test your changes. If you are fixing a known issue please add the issue number to the message.
It's always benifical to see the output of the commands, so it's encouraged to post either the _Markdown_ or _PNG_ results of the commands that have been impacted.
